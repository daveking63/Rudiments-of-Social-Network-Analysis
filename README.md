# Rudiments-of-Social-Network-Analysis
A brief overview of the key objectives and processes of Social Network Analysis along with examples of programs and code used to perform the analysis.

<h3>Introduction</h3>

To put it succinctly, *Social Network Analysis* (SNA) "can be described as a *study of human relations by means of graph theory*." 

*Graph theory* is a branch of mathematics devoted to the study of *graphs*" where a graph is defined "as a set of nodes, vertices or points connected by a set of edges, arcs, or lines." Often, the term *network* is used to encompass a graph and additional additional information about the nodes (e.g. the degree of node indicating the number of edges attached to the node) and edges (e.g. strength of the connection).  

Graph theory, graphs and networks have been used in a variety of application areas involving physical, biological, social and information systems. In the case of social systems and SNA, the nodes are typically people, collections of people sharing a one or more characteristics (e.g. programmers who know particular programming languages), or social groups (e.g. family or friends), while the edges represent the type of social relations among the nodes. In this case the goal is to use graph theory to visualize, depict, analyze and interpret the patterns of social relations among the nodes.

SNA has it's genesis in the early days of the social sciences (like sociology) dating at least to the mid-1920s and early-1930s. As a number of sources document, SNA was only of interest to small cadre of social scientists until the mid-1970s and didn't really come to the forefront until the early 2000s with the rise of social media on the Web, as well as the the availability of social media APIs (e.g. Twitter) enabling the collection of large amounts of social network data. 

With this rise came an onslaught of books and research papers devoted to network analysis in general and SNA in particular.  Similarly, there has been a rise in the availability of specialized programs and languages devoted this form of analysis and various websites devoted to these programs and languages.





Since that time there has been a plethora
